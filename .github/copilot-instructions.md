**Purpose**: Provide concise, actionable instructions for AI coding agents and contributors to discover, run, and extend this repository.

**Repository Summary**:
- This repository currently contains repository-level tooling under `tools/` used to gather metadata (`gather_repo_facts_fixed.ps1`). There are no language manifests, source directories, or CI workflows detected when the gatherer was run.

**How I discover the project**:
- Run the gather script: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\gather_repo_facts_fixed.ps1` to produce `repo_facts.txt`.
- Inspect `repo_facts.txt` for top-level files, manifests, workflows, Dockerfile, and API-contract files.

**Quick commands (from repo root)**
- Run the collector: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\gather_repo_facts_fixed.ps1`
- View results: `Get-Content .\repo_facts.txt -Raw`

**Node.js quick commands**
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the app: `npm start`
- Run tests: `npm test`

**If you are a human contributor**
- Add a `README.md` describing the project and a manifest for the primary language (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.).
- Add `.github/workflows` CI files to run tests and the gatherer automatically.

**For AI agents and automation**
- Use the gather script as the canonical discovery mechanism; do not mutate files without explicit instruction from maintainers.
- When creating or updating code, follow these steps:
  1. Run the gatherer and read `repo_facts.txt`.
  2. If manifests are missing, propose a scaffold (README + manifest). Ask the maintainer before adding language-specific scaffolding.
  3. Create minimal tests and a CI workflow to validate the change.

**Recommended next steps (high priority)**
- Add a `README.md` describing the project's purpose and the primary language.
- Add a manifest (e.g., `package.json` or `pyproject.toml`) so the assistant can provide concrete run/build/test commands.
- Add a CI workflow to run the gatherer and basic validation on push.

**Safety & secrets**
- Never commit real secrets. If environment examples are needed, add `.env.example` with placeholder values. Redact any secrets before pasting them into chat.
